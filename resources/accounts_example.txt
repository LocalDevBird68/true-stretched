The format is "<username>Ø<password>Ø", add it RIGHT after "ACCOUNT:"
DO NOT change how many lines there are in accounts.txt, leave it with only two lines as the stretched.bat depends on it.
if thats unclear, the first line should have one account, then press enter and add the credentials of the other account.
if for some reason, ur password contains Ø u gotta change ur password bro
